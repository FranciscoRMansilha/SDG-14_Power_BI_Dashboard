# :wave: Sustainable DDevelopment Goal 14 (Life below Water) Dashboard

## ðŸ¤“ Project overview

This was my first university project. It was completed in November of 2022, and it was the first time I handled data of such magnitude! ðŸš€ðŸ“Š

The objective of this project was to look into the sustainable development goals, find the one that captures us the most and use publicly available data and storytelling to answer a question about it of our choice.

Creating this project helped me learn and develop my skills about:

- Data cleaning
- Data Visualisarion
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistics
- Presentation and story-telling
- Power BI

## Problem statements:

What is the __current state of overfishing__ in the world and how can it be __reduced__?

These were the questions that I proposed to answer through an extensive analyse of publicly available data
